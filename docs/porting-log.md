# Porting log

## 2026-07-19 — verified moto-msm89xx repo names/branches before writing manifests/perry.xml

Checked github.com/moto-msm89xx directly (API + raw file contents) rather than
trusting names from memory:

- `android_device_motorola_perry` — only branches are `lineage-16.0`,
  `lineage-17.1`, `lineage-18.0`, `dynamic/lineage-17.1`. **`lineage-18.0` is
  not a real perry port** — its `BoardConfig.mk` still points at
  `montana_defconfig` and `vendor/motorola/montana/BoardConfigVendor.mk`, and
  its last commit (2020-09-14) predates `lineage-17.1`'s last commit
  (2020-11-13). It's stale montana leftovers from whatever process bulk-created
  branches across the org. Porting base is `lineage-17.1`.
- No `msm8917-common` repo exists. perry's `lineage.dependencies` pulls
  `android_device_motorola_msm8937-common` → `device/motorola/msm8937-common`
  (`TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM := msm8937` — LOS buckets the 8917/8937 family under
  one platform macro). This repo already has a real `lineage-18.1` branch.
- No `kernel_motorola_msm8917` repo exists. `msm8937-common`'s
  `BoardConfigCommon.mk` sets `TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE := kernel/motorola/msm8953`
  (`android_kernel_motorola_msm8953`), built with `perry_defconfig`. This also
  already has a real `lineage-18.1` branch. Between this and msm8937-common,
  most of the platform-level 17.1→18.1 work already exists upstream; perry's
  own device tree (BoardConfig, sepolicy, HAL versions) is the actual gap.
- perry has no dedicated vendor repo. `BoardConfig.mk` inherits
  `vendor/motorola/montana/BoardConfigVendor.mk` from the shared
  `proprietary_vendor_motorola` repo (root dirs: `cedric/`, `hannah-common/`,
  `james/`, `montana/`, `msm8937-common/`). Manifest clones the whole repo to
  `vendor/motorola`, not `vendor/motorola/montana` — `montana/` is a subdir of
  it. This repo also has blobs on a `lineage-18.1` branch already.

See `manifests/perry.xml` for the resulting local manifest (all four projects
pinned to `lineage-17.1` as the porting base, full history via
`clone-depth="0"`).
